            <p> Foldable Flight is a highly adaptable workshop with simple requirements: it only needs two sheets of A4
            paper per participant. Base content was initially provided by Questacon, but I've adapted it to a range
            of audiences and delivery modes. I've presented it from upper primary to junior secondary; in-person, as
            an online workshop (via video call to one classroom at a time), and as a webinar (to an unlimited number of
            classrooms at a time).

            <p> In adapting Foldable Flight to a year 7-10 audience at Mount Isa School of the Air, I used personal
                footage of a flight past a thunderstrom create a sense of awe. I also used the local history of
                pioneer aviation to appeal to the students' outback identities. The classroom teachers were surprised
                at how engaged their students were &mdash; well beyond usual expectations.
