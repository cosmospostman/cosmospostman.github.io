            <p>The <i>Natural Surprise & Curiosity Market Stall</i> is an outreach operation that travels around
            outdoor community markets and is run from an ironing board. It meets people where they are on a casual,
            unplanned basis, and is easier to access than a museum in a city thousands of kilometers away. A typical
            market day will see interactions with several dozen highly diverse people: aged 2 to 90; of varying ability,
            education and cultural background; and many who have little interest in academic science.
            
            <p>The "natural surprises" are delivered through simple demonstrations. They stimulate people's curiosity,
            and more significantly, ask people to change how they see the world based on astonishing, possibly
            unbeliveable, evidence. Fundamentally changing one's world view in light of evidence is a crucial ability to
            have, but people might have few opportunities to practice it in their daily lives. Carefully controlling
            an audience's curiosity gap over successive demonstrations keeps people engaged, providing an opportunity
            to deliver alternative narratives, and possibly win over skeptics and the staunchly preopinionated.

            <h3>Bubbles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Big, beautiful bubbles create awe and invite visual engagement of people passing by</li>
                <li>Bubble demonstrations offer some accessible surprises for young children</li>
                <li>For older audiences, bubbles can lead into discussions of light and optics</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Magnets and Electricity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Offers more substantial surprises and puzzles for older audiences</li>
                <li>Can be made relevant to discussions about energy and electricity production</li>
                <li>Allows audiences to construct, test and then reason using new theories</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The market stall concept can easily accommodate other content, but when operated by a single person,
            more than two topics per market day would be exhausting.
