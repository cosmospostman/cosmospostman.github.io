    <p class="text-italic text-muted">Double Helix 69, January 2024.</p>
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="column column-8 text-serif text-large">
            <p>Sailors live on their ships for months on end, too. Until last century, lightships
            (lighthouses built on boats) would float off the coast to warn of dangerous rocks.
            Lightship crews from Nantucket Island would weave baskets to pass the time.

            <p>Astronaut Dan Bursch knew about Nantucket lightship basket weaving from visiting the
            island as a child. He flew with Australian Dr Andy Thomas on Space Shuttle Endeavour,
            and crafted lightship baskets during his 190-day stay aboard Space Station.

            <p>"I didn't think of weaving in space until NASA gave me a small box to pack hobbies in," says Dan.

            <p>Other astronauts painted or made quilts. One played a fold-up guitar.

            <p>"Sewing or basketweaving has a repetitive process, which can be soothing,” says Dan.
            “It feels like you're creating something out of nothing. Doing something other than your work is very important."

            <p>Here’s how to weave astronaut Dan’s lightship baskets using household materials. Try
            it and imagine you’re relaxing after a busy day in space!

            <h3>Soaking in Space</h3>
            <p>The cane wick Dan uses needs to be wet to make it bendy for weaving. But in space,
            liquids float away and can make a huge mess! How did Dan solve the problem?

            <p>“Due to surface tension, water holds the shape of a bubble,” he says. “All I needed
            to do was keep a little bead of water at the end of a straw, and I could just pull the
            piece of cane through that.”

            <h3>You will need</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Jam jar</li>
                <li>1-litre cardboard carton (eg. soy or long life milk)</li>
                <li>Paper straws</li>
                <li>Thick cardboard</li>
                <li>Pen or pencil</li>
                <li>Rubber band</li>
                <li>Scissors</li>
                <li>Tape</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to do</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Trace the bottom of the jam jar onto cardboard and cut out the circle.</li>
                <li>Flatten the paper straws to make the staves (ribs) of the basket.</li>
                <li>Tape the staves, one by one, to the cardboard circle, so they point
                    straight out. Use an odd number of staves – we used 15.</li>
                <li> Place the cardboard circle on top of the jam jar. Pull the straws down
                    tightly over the surface of the jar and hold them in place with a rubber
                    band. This is how the basket takes the shape of the mould.</li>
                <li>Cut the top and bottom off the carton, and then cut the carton lengthwise and unfold it.</li>
                <li>Cut the carton into long, straight strips (about 1 centimetre wide). Join these strips
                    end to end with tape to make one very long strip, called a wick, for weaving. If you run
                    out of wick, just add more!</li>
                <li>Tape one end of the wick to the base of one of the staves. Then weave the
                    wick over one stave and under the next as you go around. Make sure to pull
                    the wick firmly as you go!</li>
                <li>When you get back to where you started, keep going! Start a new layer just
                    above the last. Remember to push each new row down tight and close to the previous row.</li>
                <li>Don’t go all the way to the top! Leave at least 5 centimetres of bare staves
                    poking out above the final row.</li>
                <li>Remove the rubber band and pull the basket off the mould.</li>
                <li>Fold the outside staves over the lip of the basket and tuck them into the third
                    row of wick from the top. Fold the inside staves over the lip and tuck them under
                    a neighbouring stave.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Why is an even number of staves a bad idea? Can you modify the weave to work with
                an even number of staves? Try it and find out!
