            <p>I made three lesson plans for a client wanting to motivate senior high school students to consider a
                career in software or cybersecurity. The intended audience already have an interest in computer
                programming, and the content is intended to be delivered by undergraduate computer science majors.
            <p>My work was to spin compelling narratives around three topics of the client's direction. Compared to
                plain facts, stories are far easier to remember and retain, which is what makes them so powerful. I
                researched what a small sample audience found compelling, and used that to weave in underlying messages,
                such as how writing code can be like a superpower. (It was the client's responsibility to create the
                necessary technical material and train presenters).
            <p>The client was very pleased with these lesson plans, but as of March 2022 they had not been trialled with
                a real audience.
