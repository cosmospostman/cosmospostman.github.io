    I dressed up as a talking mushroom and shared a handful of physics
    demonstrations with the punters at a bush doof.

            <p>Music festivals are a place to connect with people where they might be more relaxed, curious,
                and ready for a good time. By meeting people in this setting, you can capitalise on the shared
                cultural values it took for both of you to meet there. Here, I took inspiration from experiences
                like Guerilla Science's
                <a href="https://guerillascience.org/events/intergalactic-travel-bureau/">Intergalactic Travel Bureau</a>
                and the Cosmic Cleaning Ladies, a local roving performance.

            <p>As with the election campaign, I used costume to be noticed and open conversations. In fact, the
                costume was an evolution of the one used for the election (one voter wanted to pick a fight about how much
                waste I was creating &mdash; so I took note and reused it!). I took three demonstrations:
                <ul>
                    <li>Polarised light, sunglass lenses and cellotape on a phone screen</li>
                    <li>Internal reflection in a stream of water from a "light bong" (coincedentally shaped to evoke
                    reference to a familiar tool)</li>
                    <li>Fluorescence of tonic water under UV light; phosphorescence of plastic glow stars</li>
                </ul>


            <h3>Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>People loved the costume and concept!</li>
                <li>Some demos required darkness, but by the evening most audiences were too incoherent to meaningfully participate.</li>
                <li>This was a useful small-scale, unpaid trial. But because the costume was so cumbersome, I quickly ended up dancing instead.</li>
            </ul>
